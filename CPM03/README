This archive contains the source code of implementations of
the difference cover based suffix array construction algorithm
and the suffix array checkers described in the paper:

S. Burkhardt, J. Kärkkäinen
Fast Lightweight Suffix Array Construction and Checking
Proc. 14th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching
Springer, June 2003.

The paper and this code are available at
http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~juha/publications.html

Besides providing implementations of the algorithms is the above
paper, writing this code was also an experiment in writing STL-like
gereric code.
